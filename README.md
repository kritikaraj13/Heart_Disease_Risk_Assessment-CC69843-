---

**Project ID:** #CC69843

**Project Title:** Heart Disease Risk Assessment Internship

**Domain:** Data Science Intern

**Project Level:** Golden Level

**Assigned By:** CodeClause Internship

**Assigned To:** KRITIKA RAJ

**Start Date:** 1st AUG

**End Date:** 31th AUG 

**Project Details:**

- **Aim:** 
  - Build a user interface (UI) allowing users to input health metrics.
  - Develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease.

- **Description:** 
  - **User Interface (UI):** Create a user-friendly interface using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit. This UI will enable users to input their health data easily.
  - **Machine Learning Model:** Implement a model, such as Random Forest, to assess the risk of heart disease based on the input data. The model will be trained on relevant health metrics to provide accurate risk predictions.
  - **Integration:** Ensure smooth integration between the UI and the machine learning model so that users can receive real-time risk assessments.

- **Technologies:** 
  - **Programming Languages:** Python
  - **Web Frameworks:** Flask or Streamlit for developing the UI
  - **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn for building and training the machine learning model
  - **Other Tools:** Any additional technologies or tools that can enhance the project, such as data visualization libraries or cloud services for deployment.

- **What You Learn:** 
  - **UI Design:** Gain experience in designing intuitive and accessible web interfaces for health applications.
  - **Machine Learning:** Learn to build and train machine learning models for classification tasks, specifically for predicting heart disease risk.
  - **Integration Skills:** Understand how to integrate different components of a project, from frontend UI to backend machine learning models, ensuring they work together seamlessly.
  - **Health Metrics:** Develop knowledge about cardiovascular risk factors and how they influence heart disease predictions.
